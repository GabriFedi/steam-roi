# Steam ROI
An app to find out a steam game's ROI

## Scope

This app is hosted at https://steam-roi.herokuapp.com (USE AT YOUR OWN RISK). I haven't had time to security check the app as it is purely a proof of concept project.

Logging in allows you to see your steam account details.

Eventually, when you login you will be able to see the games you own and how much time played versus dollars each game is worth. You can then effectively determine your ROI by how many entertainment hours you received.

## In Progress

[ ] Finish front end styling

[ ] Calcualte ROI data from endpoints

## Libraries Used
